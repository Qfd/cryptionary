### About

Cryptoregister was created out of a desire to understand how the various cryptocurrency projects that exist fit together and a frustration with the hype or [fear/uncertainy/doubt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt) that’s so often spread about any given project which makes it hard to interpret what these things actually _are_.

Inspired in part by [AWS in plain english](https://www.expeditedssl.com/aws-in-plain-english), and it aspires to be [written like it might be said](http://www.paulgraham.com/talk.html).
